Banks Peninsula was almost entirely forested until the arrival of European settlers in ca. 1840 which was followed by rapid and large-scale deforestation leading to 90 % deforestation by the early twentieth century. Recently there has been a considerable increase of regenerating native scrub and forests, notably in reserve areas and along streams. However, old-growth native forests remaining today represent only ca. 1 % of their pre-human extent and the main native forests are currently regenerating kanuka (Kunzea ericoides), and mixed hardwood forests. The main other habitats are exotic grasslands mostly grazed by sheep and covering ca. 50 % of the area; exotic shrublands dominated by gorse (Ulex europaeus) and broom (Cytisus scoparius); and exotic plantation forests, mainly of Pinus radiata, covering ca. 2 % of the present area.

Hemiboreal vegetation zone is located in the southern and southwestern coastal areas in Finland. The forests there are mainly mixed, but deciduous forests more typical of central Europe also occur. Elevation varies from sea level to 150 m above sea level (a.s.l.). South boreal vegetation zone covers mostly southern and southeastern Finland. This zone is featured by mixed and coniferous forests, although pure deciduous woodlands often occur near water bodies. Elevation ranges from 80 to 360 m (a.s.l.). Middle boreal vegetation zone covers the central parts of Finland. Vegetation is mainly a mixture of coniferous forests and peatlands. Elevation ranges from sea level to 230 m (a.s.l.)

The altitude ranges from 631 to 1008 m a.s.l. The climate in this region is continental Mediterranean, with cold winters and warm dry summers. The annual precipitation ranges from 436 mm in the lowest southern part to 598 mm in the highest northern part, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 11 ◦C, respectively. This region is part of the Mesomediterranean bioclimatic domain (Rivas-Martínez, 1981). The bedrock is heterogeneous, with chalkstone being dominant and some extents of gypsum, granite, and sandstone.The vegetation in the area is a mosaic of natural, semi-natural, introduced, and crop vegetation resulting from thousands of years of human exploitation. Natural vegetation consists mostly of evergreen forests dominated by holm oak, Quercus rotundifolia. The degradation of these forests has resulted in more open woodland dominated by Q. rotundifolia, Juniperus oxycedrus, or Quercus coccifera, or to shrubland dominated by Cistus ladanifer, Retama sphaerocarpa, camephytes such as Thymus and Lavandula species, and herbs (e.g., Stipa spp.). Large extents of land were reforested with pine species (Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinea) after the 1950s, and the eldest pine plantations are now semi-natural forests (Penuelas and Ocaña, 1996). Following subsidies from the European Union, some cropland areas were planted almost entirely with P. halepensis after 1993. Most afforested abandoned cropland ranges between 3 and 15 years in age at the time we surveyed bird communities.

In each region we located 10–11 bird census plots in riparian sediment plains in a matched design with 5–6 plots with and without willow thickets, respectively. Habitats with willow thickets (Fig. 1A) had patches of approximately 80–240 cm tall shrubs that formed closed canopies surrounded by meadows with short-statured vegetation of non-woody plants (Henden et al., 2011a). Habitats without thickets either had tall willows (2 plots) so severely thinned by reindeer browsing that they no longer formed closed canopies (Fig. 1B) or (9 plots) only contained scattered small willow ramets that did not exceed in height the non-woody meadow vegetation (Fig. 1C). A recent exclosure experiment has shown that such willow ramets in riparian meadows in this study region are severely suppressed due to intense browsing (Ravolainen et al., 2011). The level of browsing even in the riparian habitats with willow thickets was high enough to cause substantial fragmentation of the willow thickets (Fig. 1A). The different intensities of browsing reindeer between habitats with and without thickets in Laksefjord were due to fencing separating summer (high browsing intensity) from autumn-spring pastures (low browsing intensity). In Varanger the two types of habitats were found in separate valleys subject to different intensities of traditional reindeer habitat use in summer (Vorren, 1962). The 10 plots with willow thickets was a sub-set of a larger sample of plots selected to investigate the effect of willow thicket fragmentation on various taxa (Henden et al., 2011a, Henden et al., 2011b). The subset was made to geographically match plots with and without thickets as much as possible. The maximum distance between plots with and without willow thickets was 5.3 km in Varanger and 3.3 km in Laksefjord. The range of altitudes (above sea-level) of plots with and without thickets was also similar (Varanger: 151–171 m with thickets and 165–184 m without, Laksefjord: 219–299 m with thickets and 233–286 m without).";"Google earth images and ref.";2010;2011;NA;"abundance";"Ims, R.

These sites represent a typical example of the Western-/Central-European agricultural landscape, where high-intensity agriculture (about 70% of the matrix) is interspersed with human settlements, industry, infrastructure, and forest stands. In each study area, three meadows with a minimum size of 0.3 ha (mean 0.8 ha, maximum 1.7 ha), located within a radius of 3.5 km and spaced at least 440 m apart, were selected for the experiment. All experimental meadows had been registered under the Swiss agri-environment scheme as “extensively managed hay meadows” since latest 2004. Under this scheme the first possible mowing date was 15 June, while neither fertilizer nor pesticide application was allowed.
